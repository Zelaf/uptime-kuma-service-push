  A bash script generator for Uptime-Kuma's Push Monitor.

  This script generates a script that checks if a service is running and pushes to Uptime-Kuma's Push Monitor. It uses systemctl to check the services and then uses curl to tell Uptime-Kuma if the service is up or down. If the service is down it will also add the last 5 lines of the journalctl logs to the message through tail.
version: 0.4.0
dependencies:
  - curl
  - tail
  - systemctl
  - journalctl
  - cat
  - readlink
  - echo
  - printf
  - mkdir

      Generate a push monitor script.

      This will generate the script that pushes an update to Uptime-Kuma.

      If the service is up it sends an OK status and a message saying it's running.
      If the service is down it will send a DOWN status and a message saying the service is down. It will also append the last 5 lines from the log.

          This will make a symlink between the generated script in the script folder and 'monitored-push-scripts'.
